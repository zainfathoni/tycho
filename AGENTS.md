# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`bin/tycho` is the executable and boots through `HQ::CLI` in `lib/hq/cli.rb`. Keep the main Bubbletea model and screen-level update flow in `lib/hq/app.rb`, config loading in `lib/hq/registry.rb`, terminal input shims in `lib/hq/bubbletea_input.rb`, domain and process-management logic under `lib/hq/domain/`, form/composer components under `lib/hq/ui/components/`, and rendering split between the aggregator in `lib/hq/ui/rendering.rb` and focused modules under `lib/hq/ui/rendering/`.


Project definitions live in `~/.tycho/config/hq.yml`, system prompt templates live in `~/.tycho/config/system_prompts.yml`, the global response style lives in `~/.tycho/config/response_style.md`, and structured managed-agent output is described by `~/.tycho/config/schemas/agent_result.json`. Project status, key decisions, and roadmap live in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`; update it when durable priorities, milestones, or architectural decisions change. Research and workflow notes live under `docs/`, including `docs/GOTCHAS.md`, `docs/REMOTE_SERVER.md`, `docs/research/charm-ruby.md`, `docs/research/codex-json-schema-research.md`, and `docs/research/claude-json-schema-research.md`.

Runtime artifacts are written to `~/.tycho/logs/`, including app state files such as `managed_agents.json`, application logs in `hq.log`, project logs under `~/.tycho/logs/projects/{project}/`, archived project logs under `~/.tycho/logs/projects/archived/`, and per-agent logs/status/result files under `~/.tycho/logs/agents/`. Keep automated checks under `test/`; the existing rendering regression coverage lives in `test/rendering_test.rb`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bundle install`: install Ruby gems declared for Ruby 3.2+.
- `bin/tycho`: start the TUI locally.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho`: run through Bundler when debugging gem resolution issues.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho serve [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 7373]`: start the local Remote Sessions JSON API and web UI for managed-agent control.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho project <key> [options]` and `project create|show|update|archive`: manage project configuration from the CLI.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho schedule [list|daemon --once|daemon --dry-run]`: list schedules, run the scheduled-agent daemon, or run a single scheduler tick.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho metrics query [filters] [--json]` and `metrics backfill [--timezone ZONE]`: query or idempotently rebuild normalized run/native-session usage metrics.
- `bundle exec bin/tycho metrics open-runs [--server SERVER_KEY] [--json]`: list managed runs that have started and are not yet durably finalized, as a closed privacy-clean payload for external reconcilers.
- `bin/test`: run the public CI-equivalent Ruby syntax and regression suite.
- `bin/remote-ui-smoke`: start a throwaway Remote UI server with temp config/log roots, create a fixture agent, and run a Chrome/Playwright smoke check for composer refresh preservation and mobile dock layout.
- `bin/remote-ui-phase2-smoke`: run the Phase 2 FRED UI smoke against the current checkout by default with isolated fixture roots; set `TYCHO_PHASE2_BACKEND_ROOT=/path/to/reviewed/archive` for a paired reviewed Beta snapshot, and set `TYCHO_PLAYWRIGHT_PATH` or `TYCHO_CHROME_PATH` when local dependencies are outside the checkout.
- `bin/remote-ui-phase3-smoke`: run the reusable Phase 3 FRED browser fixture with isolated roots, a fake harness, and real Chrome; set `TYCHO_PHASE3_UI_ROOT=/path/to/charlie/ui/checkout` for a read-only UI overlay, `TYCHO_PHASE3_CAPTURE_DIR` for JSON/screenshots, `TYCHO_PHASE3_SAMPLES` for sample count, and `TYCHO_PHASE3_REPORT_ONLY=1` when recording a known-blocked baseline. The fixture reports semantic-progress inventory timings, not active-harness load, and accepts `TYCHO_PLAYWRIGHT_PATH`/`TYCHO_CHROME_PATH` overrides.

- `bundle exec ruby test/rendering_test.rb`: run the rendering and interaction regression checks for the TUI.
- Project status, key decisions, and roadmap are documented in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- Codex and Claude structured output research notes are documented in `docs/research/codex-json-schema-research.md` and `docs/research/claude-json-schema-research.md`.
- Logs, detail views, chat, and agent forms now render in-app, including sidebar views for log inspection.

If you introduce new tooling, document the command here and keep it runnable from the repo root.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow the existing Ruby style across `bin/tycho` and `lib/hq/**/*.rb`: two-space indentation, snake_case for methods and variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants, and short guard clauses where they simplify flow. Keep classes and modules focused, and prefer small helper methods over deeply nested conditionals.


Preserve the current file-level conventions: `# frozen_string_literal: true`, double-quoted strings, and concise comments only where the code is not obvious.

The repo ships a `.rubocop.yml` that pins double-quoted string style and Ruby 3.4. `bundle exec rubocop` is not part of the bundle; if you run RuboCop locally, use the available executable and keep changes scoped to the requested files.

## Runtime Behavior & External Integrations



The app auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. Agent status is polled every 10 seconds.

Managed agents are configured from project settings in `~/.tycho/config/hq.yml`, with prompt templates loaded from `~/.tycho/config/system_prompts.yml`. Tycho appends the current `~/.tycho/config/response_style.md` policy to cold and resumed execution prompts; project/template `response_style` may override it or disable it with `false`. Codex agents use JSON output and `~/.tycho/config/schemas/agent_result.json`; Claude and custom Claude-compatible harnesses use `--output-format stream-json`; OpenCode and Pi use their native JSON event modes. Use `TYCHO_CODEX_BIN`, `TYCHO_CLAUDE_BIN`, `TYCHO_OPENCODE_BIN`, and `TYCHO_PI_BIN` to override built-in agent executables. Pi support assumes `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` 0.73.1's documented CLI/event contract. Custom Claude-compatible wrappers belong in `custom_harnesses` with `adapter: claude` and an `execution_command`; provider-specific details should live in that wrapper or command configuration, not in HQ. Native Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Pi `session_id` values are persisted on managed agents and reused after the first run; HQ still treats `memory.jsonl` as the canonical transcript and replays its complete promptable history when no native session is known. Command builders append prompt text as a harness argument rather than writing it to stdin. Preserve structured inquiry submission and focus-aware chat behavior when changing agent flows.

Delegation uses an explicit trusted parent declaration. CLI callers pass `--parent-agent KEY`; Remote API callers pass `parent_agent_key`. A message without a parent key enters Takeover, while a message with the recorded parent key preserves or restores Delegation. `TYCHO_AGENT_KEY` is an informational helper only and never causes implicit parent inference. Preserve server-local topology validation, ownership generations, run stamps, callback deduplication, and ancestor-prompt rejection when changing lifecycle paths.

Managed harnesses inherit the Tycho process environment except for Ruby/Bundler loader state and server-only credentials. Keep `TYCHO_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `TYCHO_REMOTE_TOKEN` removed at the harness spawn boundary. Remote CLI operations use the configured Remote credential store; never expose the server bearer token in prompts, logs, results, or attachments.

Remote Sessions run through `bin/tycho serve` and expose a local JSON API plus lightweight web UI for managed-agent operations. When Tailscale is available, `bin/tycho serve` auto-binds to the machine's Tailscale IPv4 address, prints the MagicDNS URL, and emits a compact terminal QR code for the UI. Keep it local-first, reuse `AgentStore`/`ManagedAgent` behavior instead of duplicating agent state transitions, and keep active-agent state persisted through `~/.tycho/logs/managed_agents.json`.

When working on `/ui` Remote UI behavior, verify browser-visible behavior in an actual browser engine, especially polling, sticky/fixed panels, form preservation, toggles, and mobile viewport layout. Prefer the Browser plugin when it is available. If the Browser plugin's control tool is unavailable, use a local Playwright + Google Chrome fallback against a throwaway `bin/tycho serve` instance with temp `TYCHO_CONFIG_PATH`, `TYCHO_SYSTEM_PROMPTS_PATH`, and `TYCHO_LOGS_ROOT` so verification does not touch real HQ agents, logs, or project config.

`HQ::CLI` enables Bubbletea bracketed paste, and `lib/hq/bubbletea_input.rb` patches `Bubbletea::Program#poll_event` with a Ruby-side input queue so multi-byte terminal reads are not truncated. Text inputs and text areas normalize multi-rune paste through `lib/hq/ui/components/text_paste.rb`. Preserve this path when changing Bubbletea startup, chat composer, inquiry forms, or agent editor input handling; pasted paths such as `lib/hq/ui/components/chat_composer.rb` should arrive intact.

## Working with Charm Ruby

Follows guidance in `docs/research/charm-ruby.md`. Use Bubbletea for TUI structure, Lipgloss for styling, and Bubbles for components like the Spinner. Keep the Elm Architecture in mind: `init` sets up initial state and commands, `update(message)` handles events and returns new state + commands, and `view` renders the current state.

When adding new UI elements, consider how they fit into the existing layout and style. Reuse the shared color/style helpers in `lib/hq/ui/rendering/styles.rb`, keep table columns aligned across Agents and Projects screens, and preserve the compact path rendering and focus-aware chat/inquiry flows that the rendering tests cover.

For input components, keep paste handling compatible with Bubbles `TextInput` and `TextArea`. Multi-character paste should insert as text, not trigger global shortcuts one character at a time.

## Testing Guidelines

This repository now has lightweight automated coverage under `test/`. Every change should at minimum pass `bin/test` and a manual run of `bin/tycho` when TUI behavior is affected.

Validate the affected key paths in the UI, especially grouped project rows, table alignment, detail views, sidebar log inspection, agent create/edit flows, agent chat and structured inquiry submission, refresh, and the `g` shortcut that opens the selected project in a terminal.

For Remote UI `/ui` changes, run `bundle exec ruby test/remote_server_test.rb` and do browser verification for user-visible behavior. A safe fallback pattern is to start `bin/tycho serve` on a spare localhost port with temp env vars (`TYCHO_CONFIG_PATH`, `TYCHO_SYSTEM_PROMPTS_PATH`, `TYCHO_LOGS_ROOT`), create fixture data through the JSON API, then drive `http://127.0.0.1:{port}/ui` with Playwright + local Google Chrome. Check concrete browser facts such as focused form values surviving `refresh({ force: true })`, details toggles preserving state across polling, mutually exclusive panels closing as expected, and sticky/fixed docks staying pinned inside the viewport.

When touching terminal input or text components, include paste regression coverage in `test/rendering_test.rb`; the existing tests cover both raw and bracketed paste for `lib/hq/ui/components/chat_composer.rb`.

When adding tests, keep using simple Ruby test files under `test/` with `*_test.rb` names unless the repo adopts a broader framework later.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short, imperative subjects such as `Fix table column alignment across screens` and `Add custom Claude harness support`. Keep commit messages in that style and scope each commit to one logical change.

Pull requests should include a brief summary, manual verification steps, and screenshots or terminal captures for visible TUI changes. Link related issues when applicable and note any changes to `~/.tycho/config/hq.yml`, `~/.tycho/config/system_prompts.yml`, structured agent schemas, hardcoded project paths, logs, or external dependencies such as Codex, Claude, or Bedrock-backed Claude execution.

Also call out changes to Bubbletea input handling, bracketed paste behavior, or Bubbles text components because they affect chat, inquiry, and agent editor typing flows.
